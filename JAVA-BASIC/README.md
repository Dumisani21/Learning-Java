# My Java Notes
> One of the most important things I learned when learning Java
> is that don't try to understand everything you see in java for example
> you'll see classes and main function with arguments you'll not 
> understand at first.
> Don't try understand things you don't need as a beginner
> Follow tutorials your learning from.

## Data types in Java

```java
int integerNum = 5; 		// Integers (-1,0,1,2,3)
float floatNum = 1.2;		// Float Numbers (1.2, 41.313)
String myName = "John";		// String ("Jake", "Friday")
char myChar = 'Y';			// Char ('y', 'n')
boolean myStatus = true;	// Boolean (true, false)	
```
## Printing in Java
> Something I have realized when learning a new programming language
> is that you need to know how to print because if you can't print
> you'll never be able to know if what your writing is actually working
> take for example your watching a tutorial on some website and the 
> person there says you should create a string variable and assign it the
> name john which will look like this:
> String yourName = "John";
> now after creating this variable how sure are you that it was
>  really create in your computer, what if the is a syntax error, you see
>  it's not easy especially if you have no experience in programming, you
>  won't be sure if the program is working or not, so this is where the
>  printing comes in now.

### Printing in java is simple all you have have to write is the following statement

```java
System.out.println("Hello World!"); // output: Hello World!
int a = 5;
int total = a + 5;
System.out.println(total); // output: 10
```

> always remember in programming practice is import
> don't just look at the code and think you'll understand it.
